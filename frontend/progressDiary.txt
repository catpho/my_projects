3/13

made usecase for photos to be saved as notes but the slideshow function is not showable 
todo list is also not very good right now 

3/14
updated so app is installable via google chrome 
when done with app functionality, refactor app into components to reuse 
make a todo app component and a slideshow component-- native carousal does not work!
experiment with voice recordings 

verbatim of lee 
* Update notes that have images take the full width of 2 columns instead of just 1
        -will need to separate the types of notes to make the notes appear differently. I want the carosaul to be the bigger container and for the notes to be in it
* DONE Update functionality where crossing something out shows it as crossed out when opening it up again (might need to update the Note model to allow each line item to have a completed/incomplete value)
* DONE Add logo to the top left portion of the Header component
* Work up a way to share notes between users

* DONE Create an audio input and audio listener component (Allow audio recording to occur over the app instead of selecting and adding an audio file)
* DONE Set up a public profile page for others to see
    -already have the folder// copy the notes version 
* Set up another version of the dashboard to view public notes
    -hand in hand with being able to share notes 
*make sure you can see when you record and when you stop 


// following week
* Set up Sendgrid Email to prompt another user to set up their own profile
* Come up with what the email should say when prompting the new user to sign up
* Start dealing with markdown after finishing most other things

// set up different providor based logins like Google accounts, apple, and maybe twitter?

// Second to final look over and think about how we might need to restyle the app for users, if changes are desired, create a list of changes

//customizable themes
//make it so you can add more photos to slideshows

4/1 
Bugs
*Cannot see when the voice recorder is starting or ending. 
*recording can only be played on the computer and not phone 
*Pictures in notes are not responsive to screen sizes. 
//*When the user goes to inspect someone else's user profile. they inherit their name. 
    **FIXED but now have issues with looking at setting for the user profile//
*When user signs into app, they do not get a loading screen 
but the same page for login until all informaiton is loaded. How to change so there is a symbol moving before the user sees content? 

4/3 
update audio note recording but the modal does not close when creating a note. 

4/4
setting up aesthetics: 
fix style of -: 
    -todo list , adding, deleting 
    -recording , FIXME: looks like tech stack for audio recording is recording RTC, with howler.js playback, and mediarecorder 
    IOS SAFARI SEEMS TO HAVE ISSUES WITH AUDIO []
    -userprofiles , a LOT of blank space 
userstore and authstore are merge together, separate them later 



4/8 
Deliverables

*make it so users can login using google and other alternatives 
*have a loading inbetween sign when a successful login occurs 
***separate the user from the auth

Landing Page//Notepad Page 
*make the view of slideshow consistent no matter the screen size
** for private notes, how can the user be able to delete them?  

Notes Edit
*fidget doesnt work, just for show for now? 
*you technically can add to the user notes with slideshows and with audio// disable it

*make it so friend request is limited one to one. Cannot have multiple requests from one person 

userprofiles
*add a little more color and design to the profiles 
*nice touch for a birthday icon to user birthdays 
*user start dates? maybe use the date to signify the length they have been a user 

Social

CHERRIES ON TOP 
*for the adding the notes, make the notes templates much cleaner and more to the theme that the notes is typed 
    -not satisfied with the notes list
    -possible to edit the to do list after adding?
