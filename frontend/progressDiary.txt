todo list is also not very good right now

updated so app is installable via google chrome

verbatim of lee 
* Update notes that have images take the full width of 2 columns instead of just 1
* Update functionality where crossing something out shows it as crossed out when opening it up again (might need to update the Note model to allow each line item to have a completed/incomplete value)
* Add logo to the top left portion of the Header component
* Work up a way to share notes between users
* Create an audio input and audio listener component (Allow audio recording to occur over the app instead of selecting and adding an audio file)
* Set up a public profile page for others to see
* Set up another version of the dashboard to view public notes

// following week
* Set up Sendgrid Email to prompt another user to set up their own profile
* Come up with what the email should say when prompting the new user to sign up
* Start dealing with markdown after finishing most other things

// set up different providor based logins like Google accounts, apple, and maybe twitter?

// Second to final look over and think about how we might need to restyle the app for users, if changes are desired, create a list of changes
